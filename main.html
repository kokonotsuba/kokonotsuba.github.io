    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Kokonotsuba is a very feature-rich BBS software that is also easier to set up and work with than most its alternatives. It's officially a software of Heyuri, and was almost exclusively developed by developers from Heyuri since it was forked from Pixmicat.</p>
    
    <h2>Required stack</h2>
    <p>OS: Confirmed to work on Debian 11 and 12. Debian 10 reached its EOL so it doesn't support PHP8.3-FPM. It should in theory work in any UNIX-based system as long as you can form the stack.</p>
    <p>PHP: It has full support for PHP8+. It currently supports PHP7.2+, but future updates won't take legacy PHP in account.</p>
    <p>Web server: Confirmed to work both on nginx and apache.</p>
    <p>Database: MariaDB. Kokonotsuba can technically work with a large range of DBs, but it has <b>certain features that only work on MySQLi</b>, and updates are done with only MySQLi in mind. So only MySQLi is officially supported.</p>
    <p>The install.php script will check these for you in the future, but kokonotsuba also needs following dependencies with PHP: gd, pdo_mysql, php_mysqli, ffmpeg, mbstring</p>
