    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Kokonotsuba is a feature-rich BBS software that is also easier to set up and work with than most its alternatives. It's officially a software of Heyuri, and was almost exclusively developed by developers from Heyuri since it was forked from Pixmicat.</p>
    
    <h2>Required stack</h2>
    <p>OS: Confirmed to work on <b>Debian 11 and 12</b>. Debian 10 reached its EOL so it doesn't support PHP8.3-FPM. It should in theory work in any UNIX-based system as long as you can form the stack.</p>
    <p>PHP: It has full support for <b>PHP8+</b>. It currently supports all versions from PHP7.2+, but future updates won't take legacy PHP in account.</p>
    <p>Web server: Confirmed to work both on <b>nginx</b> and <b>apache</b>.</p>
    <p>Database: <b>MariaDB</b>. Kokonotsuba can technically work with a large range of DBs, but it has certain features that only work on <b>MySQLi</b>, and updates are primarily made with MySQLi in mind. There is a PDO setup that should also enable full compatibility with <b>PostgreSQL</b>, <b>SQLite</b> and <b>SQLSRV</b>, but we haven't tested or confirmed it works on these drivers.</p>
