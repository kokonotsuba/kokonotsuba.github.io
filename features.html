    <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>This doesn't cover <i>every</i> feature right now. But functions as an overview of what you can expect.</p>

    <h2>Basic</h2>
    <p>Kokonotsuba has all basic features you expect from an Imageboard. Such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sage</li>
        <li>Deleting posts</li>
        <li>Tripcodes</li>
        <li>Quoting text</li>
        <li>Quote links</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Neat</h2>
        <h3>Global message</h3>
        <p>The <i>Global message</i> is a instance-wide message that the Administrator can set. It appears near the post form</p>

        <h3>Blotter</h3>
        <p>Functions as a little news section. Which will display text along with the date the entry was added. A preview can be found underneath the post form, <i>[Show all]</i> leads to a page that displays all entries.</p>
        <p>Entires can be created and deleted from the <i>[Manage blotter]</i> page. Which an Administrator can find on the link bar in <i>[Admin]</i></p>

        <h3>Banners and Ads</h3>
        <p>Kokonotsuba has a banner and ad (internally called 'fullbanner')</p>

        <h3>Overboard</h3>
        <p>The <i>Overboard</i> is a page that will show all non-hidden boards on a single page, it can be accessed from [Overboard] at the top right of the board view. Boards can also be hidden by the user with the <i>Filter boards</i> form. Which will not show any threads from boards that arent check-marked.</p>
        
        <h3>Accounts</h3>
        <p>Kokonotsuba has staff accounts. Staff can change their password and view their own <i>Action record</i> (a counter of how many bans, deletions, etc.) from <i>[Accounts]</i> in [Admin]</p>
        <p>More on account management in the next section.</p>

    <h2>Admin/mod tools</h2>
    <p>A lot of BBSes suffer from poorly written mod tools and features that make moderating the site a pain. Kokonotsuba however, has some superior implementations.</p>
        <h3>JS post deletion</h3>
        <p>If you have JS enabled on your browser. When deleting a post, attachment, or muting, some javascript will hide or modify the post's html so the page doesn't have to be fully refreshed. Which can make dealing with spam attacks a breeze.</p>
        <p>For Janitors the post will simply disapear and a message will confirm if the post was deleted or not.</p>
        <p>For Mods and above, the post will have its opacity reduced and be hidden from regular users. More on this next.</p>

        <h3>Trash bin / Deleted posts</h3>
        <p>On Kokonotsuba, deleting things doesn't automatically remove them from the system right away. Deleting a post will make it hidden from users and Janitors. This is extremely useful for preventing rogue Janitors or compromrised mod accounts from permanently wiping the board.</p>
        <p>At [Admin], if your role is high enough, you'll see [Manage deleted posts] on the link bar. On this page you'll see all deleted posts along with who deleted them, when, and optionally <i>why</i>in the form of a note.</p>
        <p>From the live view as a Moderator or above, you can see deleted posts/threads/attachments with reduced opacity and [DELETED] on them - these posts are only visible to you.</p>
        <p>You can restore any of these posts by clicking the [Restore] button.</p>
        <p>For illegal content you'll want it permanently removed from the server - which you can achieve by clicking the [Purge] button. Which will wipe the post and attachment from the database and filesystem.</p>

        <h3>Banning and Mutes</h3>
        <p></p>

        <h3>Account management</h3>
        <p>Accounts can be created, deleted, and promoted/demoted by the Adminstrator</p>

        <h3>Board management</h3>
        
        <h3>Rebuild board / Manage rebuild</h3>  
        <p><i>Rebuild board</i> will just rebuild</p>

        <h3>Autosage</h3>
        <p>Threads can be <i>autosaged</i>, also known bump lock, which prevents the thread from bumped even the reply is a non-sage.</p>
        
        <h3>Sticky</h3>  
        <p>Pins a thread to the top of the board - above all other threads. The thread will however, be only showed in its regular bump from the overboard.</p>
