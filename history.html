    <h2>レッツPHP!'s gazou.php</h2>
    <p>レッツPHP! released a software called gazou.php in ???, gazou(画像) meaning image in Japanese.</p>

    <h2>2chan's futaba.php</h2>
    <p>Futaba☆Channel modified gazou.php and created futaba.php in ????, the last releae on their <a target="_blank" href="https://www.2chan.net/script/">their script page</a> is dated 2005/10/31</p>

    <h2>Pixmicat!</h2>
    <p>In May 2005, a popular Taiwanese BBS called 2cha is closed, sparking the creation of a new imageboard environment. 
    Some guy called <b>scribe</b> starts working on a new BBS software based on Futaba. On 2005/05/22 the first version is 
    released, called <b>GazouBBS双葉改 scribe FIXED</b>. A MySQL version is later released in July.</p>
    <p>On January 2006, Pixmicat! is officially named, replacing the long project title of scribe FIXED. The name comes from 
    Pix (short for pictures) + Komica + 2cat, after the two large Taiwanese imageboards that inspired the project. On February 2006, 
    Pixmicat becomes an Open Source Software (OSS), hosted on OpenFoundry and managed by its dev team: <b>scribe</b>, <b>RT</b>, and 
    <b>Alica</b>. The first OSS version (1st.Release) is released on 2006/03/19.</p>
    <p>A major overhaul to PHP code occurs on 2006/05/13, with many redundant or inefficient parts removed and new features like DNSBL 
    blacklist, anti-spam measures, and admin tools added. On 2006/05/14, the official Pixmicat! mascot <a href="https://pixmicat.github.io/about.htm#Minamo"><b>Minamo</b> is created.</a></p>
    <div class="centerText"><img style="height: 400px;" src="src/minamo.jpg"></div>
    <p>On 2007/01/06, The PIO version of Pixmicat is completed, unifying the Log and MySQL versions under one system. 
    It introduces the PIO (Pixmicat! I/O Proxy) and FileIO libraries which sets the foundation for future versions.</p>
    <p>In March 2008, an English-language project page launched on Google Code with the aim of internationalization of Pixmicat:
    <q>Our ultimate goal is to make people think of Pixmicat! when they think of bulletin boards, and we hope that this move will be a step closer to that goal.</q></p>
    <p>On Pixmicat's 4th anniversary on 2009/05/21, the legacy Log/MySQL versions are officially retired. The focus shifts 
    to the PIO version, which no longer supports older versions of PHP (at the time, PHP4), promoting adoption of PHP5.</p>
